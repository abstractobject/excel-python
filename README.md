# excel-python
This is a project trying to automate some of the tedious, yet very important and fault intolerant tasks that are possible to automate based off the master BOM our team receives from the drafting team.
So far this program just does very simple tasks like filtering, sorting, adding.
That's about as compicated as some material orders need to be, e.g. hardware orders.
Some material orders include the old funky math that has been passed down as tribal knowledge from project planner to project planner, e.g. anglematic material orders.
Eventually this program is going to be the foundation of more than just hardware orders, but that was the lowest hanging fruit at the time.
