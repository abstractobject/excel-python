# excel-python-nesting
Goal:

This branch was created to try to add a linear nesting function for the angle and flat bar. Doing so will make material orders much more accurate than the current method of rounding and adding extra.

Reach goal: 

Linear nesting for cut tickets. I'm probably not going to make the output a complete cut ticket, but something that could be copy/pasted on to a cut ticket.
